timeout=300. % 5 minutes; shorten this for quicker testing of earlier stars

% This test performs checks to see if a star is (likely) obtained by the agent team.
% A failure of a specific condition indicates which star you failed to achieve; 
% if a condition is not listed in the test results as failed, you passed that specific criteria.
% Beware: this is not fully incremental, nor does it check percept handling and things like comments or hardcoding.

		% Check if we trained at least 3 more workers (on top of the initial 4).
		eventually bel(aggregate_all(count,friendly(_,'Protoss Probe'),N), N >= 7).
		%%% Star 2 %%%
		% Check if we obtained at least 100 gas.
		eventually percept(resources(_,Gas,_,_), Gas >= 100).
		% Check if we trained at least 4 more workers again (on top of the initial 7 we should have had for star 1).
